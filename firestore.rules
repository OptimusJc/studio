/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure-by-default posture, focusing on strict
 * authorization controls while adopting a flexible approach to data validation
 * for rapid prototyping. Data validation will be limited only to fields that are critical
 * for authorization and relational integrity. The rules enforce user ownership
 * where applicable and prevent unauthorized data access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Products are stored in top-level collections (e.g., `/wallpapers/{productId}`).
 * - Categories, Attributes, and AttributeValues are also stored in top-level
 *   collections.
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Share links created by a user are stored as subcollections under their
 *   user document in `/users/{userId}/shareLinks/{shareLinkId}`.
 * - Admin users are stored in the `roles_admin/{userId}` collection, where the document's existence grants admin privileges.
